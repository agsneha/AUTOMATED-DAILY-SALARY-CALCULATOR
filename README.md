# AUTOMATED-DAILY-SALARY-CALCULATOR
The purpose is to calculate daily salary for each employee in a firm based on their
attendance record. At the end of the day, employee will punch in their entry time, exit time,
and leave period if taken. The program takes their input into condition and perform calculations, 
giving the end user result (daily salary of each employee).

Note:
1. Edit the hardcoded input and output file path in the program.
2. Follow the format as prompted by the program for each entry of attendance details.
